Description: Mother is a python module that hides SQL syntax and gives 
        you a set of intelligent classes and methods. With `intelligent` 
        we mean the capability of self-adaption, understanding various 
        situations.
        Mother could be considered as a Object Relational Mapper with a 
        strong introspection. 
        In fact, configuration files, tables, fields and keys declarations 
        are not needed, because Mother knows the database structure herself.
        Mother works with PostgreSQL and SQlite.
